# latexcgi.github.io

## Github-Pages repository

This site is now just use for experimenting with various things.


You may be looking for a live host of the latexcgi server, please use https://texlive.net

The sources for the latexcgi server are on github at 
https://github.com/davidcarlisle/latexcgi
with documentation on github-pages at
https://davidcarlisle.github.io/latexcgi/

I may in the end move that github pages site to this custom domain.
